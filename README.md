# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I worked on getting a random password generator. I was struggling for a while trying to apply the random equation to multiple sections, but then it suddenly worked. I struggled figuring out how to use the if ands and getting multiple to work at the same time. I tried puttign the confirms into the same if statement, but that didn't work. I tried to make an array for the different characters, but that didn't seem to work either.
